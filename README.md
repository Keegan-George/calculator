# Calculator 
A simple calculator app built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Currently supports the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

This is the final project of the [Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations). It is a culmination of everything learned to this point, with the intent of testing your understanding of core web development concepts. 

Additionally, though not part of the course curriculum, this project includes both Jest and Playwright tests for validating basic functionality, integration, and e2e behaviour.
